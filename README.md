# Unity Social Distance Game

## Introduction

In response to the current global pandemic caused by the Coronavirus, we have developed an educational game to promote and practice social distancing. Social distancing is an essential measure to prevent the spread of the virus. It involves maintaining a safe space between yourself and individuals who are not from your household. By playing this game, you can learn and improve your social distancing skills while having fun.

## Game Overview

### Gameplay

In this game, you'll find yourself navigating a virtual city street. Your mission is to adhere to the social distancing guidelines and stay a safe distance of two meters away from other people on the street. To maintain your safety, you'll need to move left or right when people approach, ensuring they stay outside your "safe zone," indicated by a protective green circle (Figure 1).

### Increasing Challenge

As the game progresses, more people will appear on the street, and they will move at faster speeds, making it increasingly challenging to maintain social distance. Whenever someone enters your safe zone, your risk of infection increases.

### Health Status

Your current health status is displayed at the top left corner of the screen, represented by heart icons (Figure 2). Be cautious, as your health is at risk when social distancing is not maintained.
