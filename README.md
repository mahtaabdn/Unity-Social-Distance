# Unity Social Distance Game

## Introduction

In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we present the Unity Social Distance Gameâ€”an educational tool designed to promote and practice the principles of social distancing. Social distancing is a critical practice for preventing the spread of contagious diseases. By playing this game, you can improve your understanding of and adherence to social distancing guidelines, ensuring your safety and the safety of those around you.

### What is Social Distancing?

Social distancing involves maintaining a safe physical distance between yourself and individuals who are not part of your household. It is a key measure to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. By creating distance, we reduce the risk of infection, especially when dealing with contagious diseases like COVID-19.

**Key Principles:**

- Maintain a minimum distance of 6 feet (about two arms' length) from people who are not in your household.
- Practice social distancing both indoors and outdoors.

## Game Tutorial

In the Unity Social Distance Game, you find yourself navigating a busy street. Your mission is to adhere to social distancing guidelines, staying a safe distance of two meters away from other people on the street. Your safety is protected by a green circle, your "safe zone".

As the game progresses, more characters appear, and they move faster, making it increasingly challenging to maintain social distance. Whenever someone enters your safe zone, your risk of infection increases.

Your health status is displayed on the top left side of the screen, represented by heart icons.

Along your path, you'll find masks. Collect them as you walk. The number of collected masks is shown on the top left side of the screen with a mask icon.

If you collect an angel icon, you gain the ability to fly over the street and collect more masks.

However, remember that the game's main goal is not collecting masks but donating them to people in need. Your score is calculated based on the number of masks you donate. To donate masks, press the send icon when people are within your reach.

The objective of the game is to donate as many masks as possible before getting infected. Your score is displayed on the top left side of the screen, below the number of collected masks.

If you do become infected, an ambulance will arrive to take you to the hospital.
